#WIMMBTDemo
This is a demo of Bluetooth connectivity on the WIMM One. This chat Micro-application is designed to work with a [slightly modified version] of the BluetoothChat sample code found in Android SDK 2.1 (API 7). It allows user to initiate a Bluetooth connection to an Android phone that has been previously paired with the WIMM. It is also capable of accepting connection coming from the same Android device. After a connection has been established, you would be able to send data (message) between the two device.

For more information regarding this application, please refer to the [HOW-TO] guide over at the [WIMM Developer Guides].
